# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Azalia Cyphers**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/quilt-swamp-viscount)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I consulted my classmate from my CS1371 class, who helped me verify the conditional loop for the "guess" function.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A significant challenge that I faced when creating this submission was trying to implement the option of "losing" the game after 3 strikes. After testing countless conditional loops, initializing "strikeCounter" as a global variable, and then calling it, I struggled with figuring out just exactly how to iterate it. This challenge started to eat away at my optimism, and I grew discouraged. However, I overcame the challenge by pursuing another modification; changing the pitch associated with some buttons. The musical background in me took hold, and I decided to take what was a moment of discouragement and used it as an area for growth. Rather than just submitting the game with the initial button tones, I modified the tone for button 4 to a value of 500. This caused the buttons when clicked in numerical order from 1-4 to present a basic octave, reminiscent of my time in the orchestra. Despite the hiccup in my coding task, I used the challenge to make a connection with another extracurricular of mine, and modify the game in what was still a just as entertaining manner. I aspire to do the same when I face challenges as a future engineer; make knowledgable connections, step up to the challenge, and make an impact. I overcame my discomfort and rather greeted it, using it to change my persepctive on the situaton and complete the task at hand.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
